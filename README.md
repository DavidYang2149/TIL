# Today I Learned

## Getting Super Powers

Becoming a super hero is a fairly straight forward process:

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
